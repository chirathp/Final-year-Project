ðŸ”¹ Backend (Flask, OpenCV, Torch)
The backend is powered by Flask, handling API requests between the frontend and core logic. 
It uses OpenCV to capture and process images from the webcam, while a CNN model trained with Torch performs facial emotion recognition. 
Based on the detected emotion, the system then recommends songs using a trained music recommendation model(KNN) built from the Spotify dataset, ensuring relevant and emotion-aligned suggestions.
